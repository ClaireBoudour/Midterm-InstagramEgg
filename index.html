<p>On 4 January 2019, the @world_record_egg account was created, and posted an image of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg"> bird egg </a> with the caption, "Let's set a world record together and get the most liked post on Instagram. Beating the current world record held by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner"> Kylie Jenner</a>(18 million)! We got this." Jenner's previous record, the first photo of her daughter Stormi, had garnered a total of 18.4 million likes.
<br>
<br>
The post quickly reached 18.4 million likes in just under 10 days, becoming the most-liked Instagram post of all time. It then continued to rise over 45 million likes in the next 48 hours, surpassing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despacito#Music_video"> "Despacito"</a> music video and taking the world record for the most liked online post (on any media platform) in history.
<br>
<br>
After the account became verified on 14 January, the post rose in popularity and 'likes', which snow-balled into coverage in various media outlets.
<br>
<br>
By 18 March, the post had accumulated over 53.3 million likes, nearly three times the previous record of 18.4 million. It posted frequent updates for a few days in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram#Instagram_Stories"> Instagram Stories</a>.
<br>
<br>
Several individuals tried to claim that they were the account's creator, the claims being dismissed by "the egg" on Instagram direct messages.<a href="#noteb">[B]</a> On 3 February 2019, the creator of the Instagram egg was revealed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu"> Hulu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> to be Chris Godfrey, a British advertising creative. Alissa Khan-Whelan, his colleague, was also outed.
<br>
<br>
On 18 January 2019, the account posted a second picture of an egg, almost identical to the first one apart from a small crack at the top left. As of 25 February 2019, the post accumulated 11.8 million likes. On 22 January 2019, the account posted a third picture of an egg, this time having two larger cracks. In less than 25 minutes, the post accumulated 1 million likes, and by 25 February it had accumulated 9.5 million likes. On 29 January 2019, a fourth picture of an egg was posted to the account which has another large crack on the right hand side, attracting 7.6 million likes by 25 February. On 1 February 2019, a fifth picture of an egg was posted with stitching like that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(gridiron_football)"> football</a>, referencing the upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIII">Super Bowl</a>. That post had accumulated 6.5 million likes by 25 February 2019. The account promised that it would reveal what was inside the egg on 3 February, on the subscription video on demand service Hulu.
<br>
<br>
The Hulu Instagram egg reveal was used to promote an animation about a mental health campaign. A caption from the clip read, "Recently I've started to crack, the pressure of social media is getting to me. If you're struggling too, talk to someone." The video was later posted on @world_record_egg Instagram account which had received over 33 million views by May 2019.</p>

<p>In response to breaking the world record for most-liked Instagram post, the account owner wrote "This is madness. What a time to be alive." Hours later, Kylie Jenner posted a video on Instagram of her cracking open an egg and pouring its yolk onto the ground, with the caption: "Take that little egg."</p>
<p>Pundits pontificated on the meaning of the egg picture's dominance over social media's "first family". As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)">Vogue</a> observed, tapping a heart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictogram">pictogram</a> is easy, and eggs are "lovable". More pointedly:</p>
<p>[T]he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">attention economy</a> is a scam based on requiring little to no labor from both producer and consumer despite commanding the most space, and therefore value, in our digital lives... but it very well could be: As a metaphor for the fragility of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influencer_marketing">influencer ecosystem</a>, the egg has broken the Internet.</p>
<p>The significance of the event and its massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edition_(book)#Republication"> republishing</a> are a topic of discussion. <a href="#notec">[C]</a></p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Westminster">University of Westminster</a> researcher of internet memes compared it to the movement to name a scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel"> research vessel</a> in the United Kingdom as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaty_McBoatface">Boaty McBoatface</a>. </p>
<p>The Instagrammer's success is a rare victory for the unpaid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing"> viral campaign </a> on social media. "There is a bit of an anti-celebrity revolt here – 'look what we can do with a simple egg'"</p>
<p>The researcher suggests that the accomplishment of becoming such a widely heralded unpaid viral post may become increasingly rare, as social networks rely more on paid and business promotion.</p>
<p>It has been characterized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism">populist</a> backlash against "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism">consumerism</a>". It is seen as a triumph of community over celebrity. However, propelled by their popular success, the creators have promised to cash in to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchandising"> merchandising </a>opportunity, releasing 'egg-centric' memorabilia; thereby adopting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture"> corporate culture</a> the effort seemed to implicitly reject.</p>
<p>Hundreds of games based on the Instagram egg have appeared on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."> Apple's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS)">App Store</a>. The creators of the Instagram egg also reached a deal to promote Hulu.</p>
